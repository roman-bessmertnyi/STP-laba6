# Laba 6  
  
All words are saved into a tree made of letters.  
Some nodes are marked as word endings.  
Using this tree we can efficiently sort the words into three lists:  
- simple  
- partly concatenated  
- fully concatenated  

Also it can get the biggest fully concatenated words.  

The whole process is measured for time and memory usage.
